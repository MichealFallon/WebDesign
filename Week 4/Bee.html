        Bees make honey to feed their young and so they have something to eat during the winter.
        Bees are known as "pollinators," meaning they help plants live and reproduce by transferring pollen between various species of flowering plants like flowers. They carry pollen on their legs and body from one flower to another, helping to create what's known as "genetic variety" by distributing different genes throughout many plants and flowers.</p>
