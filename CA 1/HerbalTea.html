            <h3>Some feel that the term tisane is more correct than herbal tea or that the latter is even misleading, but most dictionaries record that the word tea is also used to refer to other plants beside the tea plant and to beverages made from other plants.[6][7] In any case, the term herbal tea is very well established and much more common that tisane. The word tisane was rare in its modern sense before the 20th centuary, when it was borrowed in the modern sense from French(This is why some people feel it should be pronounce /ti'za:n/ as in French, but the original Enlish pronunciation /ti'zaen/ continues to be more common in US English and especially in UK English).<a>More Text...</a> </h3>
